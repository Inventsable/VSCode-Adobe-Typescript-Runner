## Not yet working, but single commands in vscode will:

* Generate `tsconfig.json` to compile active `.ts` file to `.jsx` (which should become the target for your CEP extension) on save
* Prompt VSCode reload for changes to take effect
* Provide access to target app's OMV as autocompletion hints as you type
* Allow customizeable hotkey commands to run active `.ts` in target app as a virtual `.jsx` document
